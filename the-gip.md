The Guild of Incompetent Programmers (GIP) is a group of programmers who are *doing it wrong*. Even though the GIP as a name, entity or organization is not very well known, most people have encountered one of its members or at least work introduced by one of them. There are a few sister organizations too, like the Guild of Incompetent Designers and the Guild of Database Bullies, but for now though, I'm focusing on the GIP.

Members of the GIP often subscribe to quite a few (if not all) of the following ideas:

* Big design up front (BDUF)
* Do everything imperatively and embrace global state
* Tool is a hammer, every problem is a nail
* OOP is all about classes, taxonomies and inheritance
* Solution over problem
* Be clueless about the field of software development
* Shy away from learning
* Don't use concurrent version control

The GIP as a whole is a group of programmers who enjoy in reinventing the wheel over and over for every problem they face. It might be any combination of sheer obliviousness and/or an angst for new things and threading on unfamiliar territory. Or it might be something else altogether. Anyway, they are doing it wrong and cause themselves and a lot of other developers a lot of grief in the process.

In the upcoming weeks I'm going to look more closely at the ideas listed above and why they should be considered evil.
