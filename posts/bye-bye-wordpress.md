Today I stumbled onto Dropplets, a fresh new CMS. And as I was getting a bit annoyed with the bulkiness of WordPress lately I decided to try it out. So far, I'm kinda impressed and I especially like the fact that I don't need a database anymore.

There's still some things I need to find out, for example how to fix the missing image to the left. Also, I need to convert some of my older posts into markdown so I can upload them here but that's a small price to pay.

In the end I fixed the missing image problem by uploading the file into the cache folder where Dropplets was looking for it. Bleh... I'm quite sure that this isn't the proper way to fix it but I wasn't in the mood to fiddle around with either PHP or folder permissions.
