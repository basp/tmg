This is just a recap of some current projects I'm working on.

# Dime
Database Initialization and Migration Engine (dime) is a RoundhouseE inspired tool. But instead of being database oriented, it's server oriented. The unfortunate fact is that I have to work with several individual databases that have to be migrated as one.

# Lime
Lime stands for nothing. Just lime. It's my new thingy to manage my blog. It's basically Jekyll minus a lot of stuff. I don't really like Ruby anymore so I ported the stuff I needed to Go. Jekyll is awesome and worth checking out though.

# VanityMOO
My MOO... It's a few things still disconnected. My goal is to port LambdaMOO to something like Go (or maybe D or Nimrod or something) but I'm still far off. I have a few succesful spikes on individual components but still need to tie them together.

# Writings
There's a lot of stuff still on the shelf, half finished or kinda finshed but unedited. There's also a lot of material that has to be republished. I salvaged some of the stuff but I might need to work a bit to get older material back.

# Random
There's always some random problem. Loads of individual stuff that needs to get fixed/improved on lime before I can actually recommend using it so that's high on my list. Besides that really want to actually play some good MOO's too and `HellMOO` and `Wayfar1444` are on top of my list.
