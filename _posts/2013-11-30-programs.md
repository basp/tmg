The heart of Aki is a stack based bytecode interpreter that runs a `Program`. When a player types a command, the `handler` (the routine handling the player input) will try to find a `verb` matching the command. Verbs are small programs that are attached to objects and in their most primitive form, they are a sequence of a special kind of bytes, `Opcode` bytes. These are still bytes but they can hold on to some extra information. So currently, when you inspect a small program you see something like this:

    [29 0 0 0 0 29 0 0 0 1 15 29 0 0 0 7 29 0 0 0 8 29 0 0 0 5 11 8 35 29 0 0 0 7 29 0 0 0 8 29 0 0 0 6 11 8 35 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 4 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 29 0 0 0 0 29 0 0 0 1 15 52 11 9 0 0 0 0 15 33]

Which is indeed a sequence of bytes (output by Go) and it's really amazing to see something so simple spring to life a while sequence of actions.
