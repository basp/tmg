# Opionionated AI corp newbie guide
Welcome to Wayfar 1444. This guide is here to help you get started playing the game but keep in mind that this is an _opinionanted_ guide. That being said, it will set you upon the path of being self sufficient which is one of the primary goals.

## About Wayfar1444
Wayfar1444 is a MOO that is built upon HellCore. It's the only playable game I know of that has been built on hellcore. In fact, this game and hellcore are tied togehter in more than one way on more than one level.

You are not hare to read about the history of Wayfar1444 though. That can wait. The rest of this guide will explain how to go from a lowly newbie to a pro Wayfar1444 player.

## Starting out for the first time
Starting out for the first time is a little bit different because more mechanics need to be explained. If you are completely new, start here.

	rusting bucket seats in the back of a cheap shuttle
	This squalid shuttle barely made the trip down from the sweltering star liner. The sooner you leave, the better. You can do so by typing: OUT.

The game will explain most of the actions at this point so just play along.

	> out
	You walk out.

	commerce main junctionway [3, 3, 2]
	The junctionway hums with passing traffic.  Travel zones lead north and south to the outfitting and sales 
	district.
	  Complex technician and a medical dog (dw-17523) are standing here.
	You see a shuttle terminal and an economic loan terminal here.
	[ Exits: north east south west in ]
	Complex technician [to Rayne]: Oh! Hello, I didn't see you there.

The game might give you a hint to add a description. It might also direct you to the next target. Feel free to follow anything the game says for fun and profit but for the guide you should go east and check out the colony dispatch terminal.
