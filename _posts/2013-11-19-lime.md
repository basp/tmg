title: Lime (it's alive)
layout: post

A few weeks ago I got rid of my WordPress install and replaced it with Dropplets. I tried to accomplish two things with this:

1. Make it easier to write and publish posts
2. Make it faster

Writing and publishing posts is now a lot easier than it was before but unfortunately my site is still not very fast. In fact, it feels quite sluggish. 

Then I ran into Jekyll via another project and this got my attention - why not generate the site statically? This should definately make it somewhat faster. I don't like Ruby that much though and needed another pet project for Go so Lime was born.

Lime is a lot like Jekyll only not as fancy. Also, it is a single self-contained executable and it's very fast.
